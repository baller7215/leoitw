    <p>The 2020 NBA Finals is the championship series of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 2019–20 season and conclusion of the season's playoffs. This best-of-seven playoff series is being played between the Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat and the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers. This is the first NBA Finals matchup between the two teams, and the first time both NBA Finals participants had missed the playoffs in the previous season. The Lakers' LeBron James had previously played with the Heat winning back-to-back NBA titles in four consecutive Finals appearances from 2011–2014, while Heat president Pat Riley was head coach of the "Showtime"-era Lakers from 1981–1990 leading them to four NBA titles from seven Finals appearances. For the first time after five seasons, the Golden State Warriors are not in the Finals.
    <br><br>
    The games were originally scheduled to begin on June 4 and end on June 24, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the best-of-seven playoff series is being played behind closed doors at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex inside Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida starting on September 30, with a possible game seven taking place on October 13.
    <br><br>
    The league suspended the season on March 11 after some players tested positive for COVID-19. The NBA and its players then approved a plan in early June to restart the season beginning in late July, setting up the NBA Bubble at Walt Disney World to protect teams from the virus.</p>

    <p><em>I would rate this assignment as a 4/5 as I thought it was mostly fun and is good practice although I have already done something like this before. I also like how you give us a lot flexibility with what we can include in the website which is nice.</em></p>
