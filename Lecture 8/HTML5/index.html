        </a>
        <p>Luka Dončić has put up historic numbers through first two NBA seasons, producing one of the best starts to a career the league has ever seen. He turned just 21 years old on Feb. 28, 2020, and finished with the second-highest scoring average (24.2 ppg) by a player before his 21st birthday in league history (LeBron James, 25.0 ppg). He also produced 21 of his franchise-record 25 triple-doubles before his 21st birthday, by far the most by a player before turning 21 in league history.</p>

        <p>"At the age of 18, Luka helped lead Slovenia to the greatest success in the history of Slovenian team sports: the title of EuroBasket champions in 2017, during which he was selected to the All-Tournament Team. In the 2016–2017 season, he was named round MVP four times on his way to earning the EuroLeague’s Rising Star award. The next season he became both EuroLeague MVP and Final Four MVP, leading Real Madrid to the EuroLeague championship title. His dreams became reality when he was selected 3rd in the NBA Draft by the Dallas Mavericks. All of these achievements, reached in his youth, are just the beginning of something even greater. According to basketball experts, only the sky is the limit for Luka."
