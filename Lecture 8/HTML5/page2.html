        <p>Luka Dončić was born in Ljubljana on <em>February 28, 1999</em>. He began to show his love for the basketball very early. From his very first steps the ball was always on the top of the wish list for birthday presents. Although he already had many, he always found one that he had not had yet.        </p>

                    After an outstanding first season that saw him earn Kia Rookie of the Year honors in 2018-19, Dončić garnered All-NBA First Team accolades as a 21-year-old in 2019-20. He became the first player to earn All-NBA First Team honors in either his first or second season since Tim Duncan in 1998-99. He also became the sixth player in league history to be named All-NBA First Team at age 21-or-younger (James, Max Zaslofsky, Kevin Durant, Duncan, Rick Barry). Dončić joined the great Dirk Nowitzki (2004-05, 2005-06, 2006-07, 2008-09) as the only Mavericks to be tabbed All-NBA First Team.

        <h1 class="asidetitle">Without using relative or absolute positioning, what is another way to organize elements on a page?</h1>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;">There are several other ways. Such including using the properties padding, margin, width, height, and float. Additionally another way which I use to organize elements is through a css grid.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Padding: </em>used to generate space around an element's content inside any borders. This can be used to make an element move up, down, left, or right.</li>
            <li><em>Margin: </em>used to control the space outside an element and its borders1. Can also be used to move an element in all four directions.</li>
            <li><em>Width: </em>utilized to manipulate the width of an element.</li>
            <li><em>Height: </em>utilized to manipulate the height of an element.</li>
            <li><em>Float: </em>can be used to shift elements to the left, right, or middle of the page.</li>
            <li><em>CSS Grid: </em>used to place and organize objects in a grid.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 class="abouttitle" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Colors and Images</h1>
        <p>All of the colors I chose and used throughout the 3 pages are all related to blue. I chose to make blue the main color since the team for which Luka Dončić plays for, the Dallas Mavericks, has blue as one of its primary colors too in the organization, court, jerseys, and practically everything. I also chose these specific gradients with accents of blue for the backgrounds of the pages since not only did I think they looked nice, they also made the text an elements in the pages easy to read. <br><br>
        In terms of the images, I chose these images because I thought they looked good and fit in with the topic of the section. For instance in my 3rd page (NBA) in the section Accolades, it talks about Luka Dončić winning the Rookie of the Year Award. As a result to accompany the text, I also put images of Luka holding the award.
